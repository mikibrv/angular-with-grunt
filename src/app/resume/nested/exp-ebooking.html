        <br>

        <p>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Secure software solution for holiday bookings with more than <b>200k daily transactions</b>
            (availabilities, quotes, bookings) providing a <b>large portion of the company's revenue</b>.
        </p>

        <h4>Connectivity (Integration)</h4>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Started in pair-programming & TDD with a senior developer for the first 6 months.
            Changed roles when he was replaced by a junior under my guidance.
            In the end I worked alone with occasional interactions with the developers working on
            software consuming my webervices. Provided a knowledge sharing at the end of the contract for
            2 developers in Paris.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Connected 32 tour operators with Promovacances allowing direct sales of partner products.
            Some of them were using an XFT standard:
            http://www.exchangefortravel.org/en/xft-language-business-solutions,
            but each required a specific implementation at some level, perfect environment for <b>enterprise integration
            patterns</b>.
            There were differences starting from
            message logic, semantics, transaction verbs to webservice types. Software security procedures were ensured
            while maintaining a fallback for any kind of disruption.
        </p>

        <p>I have designed and built the UI for several internal metrics tools.</p>

        <h4>Room repartition algorithm</h4>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            This was done by creating <b>all possible permutations</b> of adults, search of available
            rooms based on their capacity specifications and further addition of childrens based on age groups.
            <b>Repartitions had a score</b> depending on the number of rooms and the remaining empty occupancies in
            them.
            The repartition with the highest score is the one having the smallest number of rooms in which you can
            fit exactly the highest number of travellers.

        </p>
        <h4>Sales lead algorithm</h4>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Developed a rating system for possible sales (leads) used by call center agents in real time
            to pick-up the <b>customers who have the highest chance of purchasing a product</b>, while surfing on our
            websites.
