        <p>
            Joined 18 months after dev started, when major refactoring was required to achieve performance.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Provided java development and scalability / performance refactoring for a startup
            focused on
            <b>fast image, video and audio processing.</b><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbspMost <b>challenging task</b> was related to files synchronization between the Orange Cloud and
            our own Amazon S3 storage.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Micro services architecture on <b>Amazon EC2</b> with an ELB in front of each cluster of
            services.
            I had full access to servers, both in production and in a small scale replica we used for testing.
            My work consisted of <b>developing new features </b> (eg: short-links, counters, Orange API integration)
            and <b>improving performance</b> by benchmarking and redesigning architecture and processes.
            <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Due to performance issues and high costs concerning the current architecture I have moved
            communication between micro-services from HTTP to an AMQP software (rabbitmq).
            I had to remake parts the schema of the database (MongoDB) with several aggregations selected by
            the way we are using the database and not by respecting some SQL principles as it was before.
