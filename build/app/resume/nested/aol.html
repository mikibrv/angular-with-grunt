        <h4>Global Day of CodeRetreat</h4>

        <p>
            Attended 2 years in a row: http://coderetreat.org/<br>

        <p>Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development
            and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice away from the pressures
            of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill
            improvement. Focus on TDD (Test driven development).</p>
