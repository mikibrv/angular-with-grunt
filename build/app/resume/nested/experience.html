        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Scalability</b> for me, represents the quality of a system to be able to serve a number of
        customers in an acceptable time for
        specific business requests. ( video processing takes longer than image so we can say it's acceptable for an user
        to wait ) .<br><br>

        <b>It's an aggregation of money invested into servers and a fine architecture.</b>

        <br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;You can buy 10k servers ( horizontal scaling ) or upgrade their hardware (vertical scaling ) but
        your business will not scale unless you have software which can adapt.

        Having an architecture which can scale up and down based on the number of customers might mean the difference
        between spending lots of money and going bankrupt or fine-tuning your costs based on the demand.
