        <p>
            Joined 18 months after dev started, working alone.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Provided java development and scalability / performance refactoring for a startup focused on
            <b>fast image, video and audio processing.</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Full access to servers both in production and pre-production (a small scale replica).
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Micro services architecture on <b>Amazon EC2</b> with an ELB in front of each service (cluster).
            Several services were moved behind a RabbitMQ.<br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;My work consisted of <b>developing new features </b> (eg: short-links, counters, user
            stories)
            and <b>improving performance</b> by benchmarking and redesigning architecture and processes.
            <br><br>

        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Due to performance issues and high costs concerning the current architecture and
            database we have agreed that I will rewrite and redesign the entire backend. They wanted
            a new language so I have picked Scala with Akka Framework, Spray.io webservices and ReactiveMongo.
            I have also remade the schema of the database (MongoDB) with several aggregations selected by
            the way we are using the database and not by respecting some SQL principles as it was before.
