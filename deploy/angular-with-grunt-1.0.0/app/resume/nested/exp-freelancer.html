        <p>
            Worked on several PHP projects in the gaming industry( private Silkroad MMO servers
            http://www.xtremetop100.com/silkroad-online, http://www.maximizedphantasy.com/ ) providing web development
            for specific game related actions ( register, password recovery, unstuck, donations, marketplace etc ).
            Provided both PHP and UI development using CSS and Javascript (jQuery).<br><br>

            Websites were hosted on different servers being linked to the game server through a <b>PHP REST
            webservice</b>.
            Due to performance issues we decided using simultaneously 2 database solutions:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Microsoft SQL Server (due to the fact that the game was running on it )
            </li>
            <li>
                MySQL storing data not bound to the game server ( necesary for website only - marketplace items, logs,
                internationalization and localization).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
            Through these projects I self-taught web development patterns ( Singleton, Object pool, Abstract
            factory, Lazy initialization, Front Controller, MVC, SOA and others),

            Beside this I learned to communicate with various people around the world who were contributing to these
            private
            server, mostly from the arabic area.

            I have built an announcement board in PHP for the college institution front entrance, containing a
            slideshare of
            announcements made by college officials and the current schedual for all classrooms in the facility.
            Moreover I
            have added a GIF built map containing steps from the entrance to each room in the building.
            Through an administration page college officials with a designated username and password were able to change
            scheduled classes and add announcements.

        <h4>Custom management webapps</h4>
        <h5>Target: small local businesses</h5>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Internet is full of ads about front-end presentation websites but if you want something custom
            made to
            manage your bakery, car rental agency or whatever else it will cost you a lot. I built several back-office
            solutions
            for small businesses in the area fit for their needs at a low cost.
