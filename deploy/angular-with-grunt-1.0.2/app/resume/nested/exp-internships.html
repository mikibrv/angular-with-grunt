        <h3>internship coordinator</h3>
        summer of 2014
        <hr>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I picked 7 students after an <b>interview phase</b> to join us in the office for 3 weeks.
            I have prepared a technical roadmap for them to follow involving Java (SE & Servlets), jQuery and HTML/CSS.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of study we simulated a project where they had to work together to meet
            business demands of a simulated travel agency.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the internship the best student was hired.

        <b>Technical interviews</b> with several junior developers.
        <hr>
        Tutored several new junior developers:
        <ul>
            <li>
                3 java developers with spring + hibernate.
            </li>
            <li>
                1 angular / front-end developer
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I insisted on more technologies than their position required, offering them a better perspective of
        web development.
