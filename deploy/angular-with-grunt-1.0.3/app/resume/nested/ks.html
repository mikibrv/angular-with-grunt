        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Sustained a workshop on using <b>Apache Camel</b> to implement <b>Enterprise Integration
            Patterns</b> for real time data analysis using a <b> master slave distribution.</b>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked every participant to download the code and open a bat file, starting a maven exec
            plugin.They have all connected to my laptop acting as a master which load balanced tweets to them from
            Twitter Stream API for further analysis.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I have proved the power of parallel analysis and also of <b>MongoDB aggregation framework</b> to
            speed up processes.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;Communication was done using ActiveMQ and Spring Remoting (remote bean invokation).

        <h4>Apache Cassandra</h4>

        <p>
            After building a PoC with Cassandra for a customer and participating at a Cassandra meetup in Paris
            I have sustained an internal KS demonstrating the ease of use and the power of Cassandra when working
            with a cluster handling large amount of data.
